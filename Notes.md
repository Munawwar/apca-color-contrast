## Notes on understanding APCA score levels:

Level 5: A more preferred ideal to shoot for, but does not give extra conformance points than 4. (So that 4 is not considered Level the "best target")
Level 4: The desired minimum score.
Level 3: Okay (catch-all for near-miss).
Level 2: Deficient - But we can't really *fail* it.
Level 1: Poor - Bare minimum even for normal vision.
Level 0: Fail

## Comparison to WCAG 2.x
AA is sort of like 1, an inadequate minimum that should not be the goal.
AAA is sort of like 3 to 4. 

Except both AA/AAA may be too much, or too little, on several cases.
